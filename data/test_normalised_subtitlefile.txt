izuna 
please 
when's the last time you thought a game was fun 
but you're going to lose 
blank doesn't lose 
this is fun 
what 
a double jump 
you've gotta be kidding 
cheater 
i is that 
the ability that only a few warbeasts possess to overcome their own physical limits 
blood destruction 
i won't lose 
then one hundred rule number ten 
that's not just a double jump 
that's a bug 
i can't predict what she'll do 
huh 
huh 
the difference between their strengths is overwhelming 
this battle is already over . but i never expected all this 
i can't calculate what to do didn't i 
so physics equations won't help you 
brother leave everything to me 
let your brother's bluffs take care of it and try to block both sides 
she'll fire down the middle 
two shots 
no 
this is what izuna was after 
sora and shiro's heartbeats have both gone flat 
a perfect headshot 
there's no way to disguise that 
izuna 
i won 
i won 
i did it 
what was that 
s sora 
was that okay 
can i open my eyes now 
shiro 
are you two there 
looks like it worked 
yeah 
was that their plan 
right she wasn't aiming for you 
i was aiming below who was being carried by one of the girls below 
what 
npc movement is controlled by certain rules 
you can predict where they'll be 
and npcs don't make a sound as they walk 
you couldn't sense her desire to attack you 
it was impossible to detect her 
i bound steph with the pledges to obey any order but to forget it . wait until your energy is just about to run out and then fire straight ahead 
all we had to do then was calculate the npc's movements and lead her there 
impossible 
that's right 
mister 
you've been monitoring our heartbeats the whole time and right 
impossible and took advantage of it 
there are only two actions you can take in a game . or respond to another player's strategy 
it's a question of who has the initiative 
we held the initiative throughout the entire game 
that's all there is to it . but we were controlling what you did 
it wasn't precognition 
the result was inevitable 
the weak have their own way of fighting 
we leave it to the strong to fight each other head on 
old man 
the winner is elkia . the eastern federation turns over all rights it owns on the continent to the kingdom of elkia 
brother so why did you aim for my panties 
don't ask that 
you know the answer 
i couldn't let all these people see you naked 
you're talking like it doesn't matter if they see me naked 
dola chan 
jibril 
good work 
you did everything according to plan 
well done 
master 
now 
now the eastern federation is 
the warbeasts are it's not your fault 
and i ordered it 
izuna 
because you had fun 
right 
that's impossible 
so many people are going to suffer because i lost 
but you were 
izuna tan 
why 
why did i smile and so many people will 
and it's all my fault for having fun 
don't worry 
no matter what you thought 
well 
how does it feel to know no matter how hard you try 
to put it mildly 
it's awesome 
right but that's why it was fun 
you're a friend of ours 
izuna 
you're a gamer now 
i won't lose 
you seem to have the wrong idea about this 
and nobody's going to suffer 
this world is a game 
everyone here fails to understand that . born of imanity's learning and experience 
fine 
i'll believe in it 
we're heading home 
there's a lot to do 
right 
i hate baths . your objection is denied 
you're really into this today 
i was so excited about washing izuna tan's tail 
that tickles especially given how pessimistic you were after the fight 
brother talked to izuna tan afterwards 
he told her why nobody will suffer even if the eastern federation is absorbed into elkia 
what is it 
huh you bald monkey 
lies 
i only told her the truth 
what 
don't worry 
there's nothing you could do 
besides no 
the eastern federation 
the eastern federation 
the eastern federation moved all of their major technology and personnel off the continent right 
you knew 
obviously 
so why didn't you stop them 
but now 
it's fine 
the game isn't over 
designated representative of the eastern federation 
you guys look like you're having a great time 
may i join you 
the shrine 
the shrine priestess 
i'm the shrine priestess 
nice to meet you 
kannagari where we read poetry beneath the light of the moon 
one shrine priestess's shrine 
are you sure you want to let these bald monkeys come here 
it's fine 
right 
sorry 
a golden fox girl 
can i take a picture 
stop it 
these are vips from another country 
you need to be polite 
bald monkey 
i'm impressed by the elves 
they were faster than i thought 
the elves 
what do you mean you can't make good use of your territory 
you'll come to challenge us again 
you thought 
truly and expose the nature of our game to ensure that we couldn't win 
but 
i expected that 
i thought you were elven garde spies yourselves 
but i didn't expect you to get avantheim involved 
how long have you been planning this but i was once a member the avantheim government 
i have a formidable degree of influence 
and elkia . but not the elves or the flugel 
for goodness sake 
and that's why 
the eastern federation is going to take revenge on elkia immediately 
shrine priestess 
shall i say it again 
bald monkey 
your death won't be painless 
all right 
i accept your challenge 
i'm tired of complicated schemes 
let's settle this quickly with a coin toss 
not good enough 
it's just that when i think that half my life and now it all comes down to a coin toss 
it's hilarious 
too . including the island off the continent . and a guarantee of resources from the continent . you're more concerned about preserving the warbeasts 
it's over 
that's all i can do . and my people 
shrine priestess 
i've changed my opinion of you 
just get started 
let's start the world's most brutal coin toss 
you can pick heads or tails as it lands 
i'll take the other 
you're sure 
yeah 
okay 
aschente 
blood destruction allowing me to grasp all signals and movements . and stop on tails 
i don't detect any magic usage within range 
did they underestimate my kinetic vision 
that's impossible 
but 
tails 
wh what is this 
a draw 
a draw 
i didn't see that coming 
what a problem 
did we both win or did we both lose 
which is it 
you're not fooling anybody 
truly 
this was your goal from the start 
that means both of our demands are fulfilled 
eastern federation elkia but your rights are assured and you keep the right to self rule 
warbeasts 
we can both share the continent's resources 
the eastern federation becomes the elkia federation 
elkia federation 
well 
or do we both lose 
which do you prefer 
weren't you going to take over the 
eastern federation and destroy the warbeasts 
that's totally wrong 
why would i destroy my animal girl paradise 
it's a race filled with ultimate pretty animals like izuna 
why the hell would i want to destroy a treasure like that 
one animal ear love one cute is ultimate justice 
brother 
really 
so we really were playing into your hands the whole time . the elves know our secrets 
elven garde will declare war on us someday 
i'm sure they will 
let's kick their asses 
you think you can do that 
i can 
our spy actually had her memories altered by the pledges before she reported to elven garde 
so she gave them the wrong information about your game 
so the reason you fought kurami for the right to alter her memories was for this day 
we're sure to win 
too 
you thought it through that far 
checkmate doesn't mean you've simply cornered the enemy king 
it's a declaration that the enemy king is yours 
that's why i said it the first time i met you 
checkmate 
which will it be 
or do we both lose 
are you really going to make me say it 
meanie 
we both win 
now one thousand, four hundred find a place to stay learn about this world get a flugel take over the eastern federation 
the elkia federation is born 
what are you going to do 
don't tell me you're going to start another great war 
i would've taken your race piece 
so we won't 
yup 
our goal has never changed 
it's simple and straightforward 
beat tet 
that's all 
beat him 
he's the one true god 
yeah 
and 
is that a problem 
you're going to try and beat a god 
you come up with the funniest ideas 
do you think you can do it 
dunno but we have hints 
why are the race pieces shaped like this 
second in this world 
third 
what are those things i see on the horizon 
gathering all the pieces is what gives you the right to challenge god 
but doesn't that mean you have to take our race pieces 
nope 
that would go against the pledges 
the pledges 
why put a rule into the pledges that doesn't and any game may be played 
five 
the challenged party has the right to decide the rules of the game 
one ten pledges have to be followed 
what do you mean 
the previous rules may never be changed 
ten 
let's all have fun and play together 
did you forget 
pledge ten 
ten 
let's all c hfff eight century eight have fun and c hbdeacaplay together 
let's all have fun and play together . we can't beat the game 
we don't steal each other's pieces . to build a tower of wisdom on disboard 
prove to me that you have wisdom at all 
that's great 
wonderful 
this really is getting fun 
i really was right to bring you here 
i'm waiting 
with all the races in tow 
and then though from within 
what are you going to do 
i want to know it 
but we have to do it 
that's the only way for imanity to win 
kurami but still defeat the strong 
but surpass your limits 
even if you can't fly and darkness 
am i 
you've changed a little 
have i 
maybe i feel like i can't lose now 
so 
will you help me 
of course 
kurami 
let's do it 
sora 
let's get going 
yeah 
but there's still 
i know 
wh what you bald monkey 
but right 
we've been wondering 
wh what is this 
what power 
divine core manifestation 
mind meld established 
power setting minimal 
you with finite lifespans 
old deus 
exceed rank one 
old 
deus 
okay 
let's begin the game
